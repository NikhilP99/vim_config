# Vim Configurations

## Minimal Configurations
If you are looking for basic text editing configuration with no extra plugins, use the config file from the minimal folder. It has some MUST have brainless configurations. Take it as a boilerplate and build your vim over it.

## Advanced (not really) configurations
It has my personal configurations including themes, airline and some other plugins which make me overall more productive. I use Vundle as my plugin manager. This configuration file is frequently updated and is always moving towards more productivity.

NOTE: Rename the file to .vimrc and place in your home directory.

Happy Vimming!
